# Lemmings Clone in C++ ðŸš¶

This project is a clone of the classic DOS game Lemmings, originally developed by DMA Design in 1991. The goal of this clone is to replicate the original gameplay as part of a course on C++.

# Current status
The clone is still in development, with some key features already implemented, including:
* Basic Lemmings AI.
* Level loading and destruction

# Level structure:
The level file structure is quite simple but does not conform to any standard.
